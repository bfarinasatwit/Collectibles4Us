When docker is composed, you may interact with the front-end in PRODUCTION MODE with localhost

- no realtime code updates
- better performance
- takes a while to spin up
- Need to configure fetch statements for this mode

You may also interact in DEVELOPMENT MODE with localhost:3000 
by closing the docker node server and running npm run start

- realtime code updates
- worse performance
